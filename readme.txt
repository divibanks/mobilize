Mobilize adds a lightweight mobile menu to your site, if the width is lower than a certain value.

== Description ==

The **Mobilize** plugin adds a lightweight mobile menu to your site, if the width is lower than a certain (configurable) value.

Use the native behaviour (fixed top bar) or assign one of your existing menu items (a hamburger icon or a "Quick Jump" menu item).

The menu works with the latest WordPress version and is fully compatible with the block editor (Gutenberg).

= Features =

ðŸŒŸ **Responsive Navigation Menu:** Mobilize automatically transforms your website's navigation into a user-friendly mobile menu when the screen width falls below a specified threshold (default: 768px). This ensures optimal usability for your visitors on various devices.

ðŸŒŸ **Custom Menu Integration:** Assign your existing WordPress menus or create a dedicated menu specifically for the mobile experience. Mobilize provides a separate menu location, allowing you to tailor the navigation structure for smaller screens.

ðŸŒŸ **Reusable Block Support:** Enhance your mobile menu with additional content by easily inserting a reusable block from the WordPress block editor. This feature lets you add extra functionality, such as search forms, social media links, or any custom content you desire.

ðŸŒŸ **Customizable Appearance:** Personalize the look and feel of your mobile menu with various color options for the background, text, links, and accent elements. Choose from two pre-defined themes or create your own unique style.

ðŸŒŸ **Sliding Animation:** Mobilize offers a smooth sliding animation when opening and closing the mobile menu, providing a polished user experience. You can even choose the direction (left or right) for the sliding animation.

ðŸŒŸ **Easy Setup and Configuration:** With a user-friendly options page in the WordPress admin area, you can quickly set up and customize Mobilize to suit your website's branding and requirements.

**More menu themes coming soon!**

Give your website's mobile visitors a seamless and delightful navigation experience with Mobilize. Enhance usability, engage users, and provide a consistent brand experience across all devices.

1. Upload to your plugins folder, usually `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin on the plugin screen
3. Configure the plugin from **Settings** -> **Mobilize**
