The Mobilize plugin adds a lightweight mobile menu to your site, if the width is lower than a certain (configurable) value.

Use the native behaviour (fixed top bar) or assign one of your existing menu items (a hamburger icon or a “Quick Jump” menu item).

The menu works with the latest WordPress version and is fully compatible with the block editor (Gutenberg).
